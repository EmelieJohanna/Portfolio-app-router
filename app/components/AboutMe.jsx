        <p className="mb-4">
          Hi, I'm Emelie, a Frontend Developer with an interest in building
          engaging user experiences. I was inspired to pursue this path by the
          supportive tech community around me and my natural curiosity.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Recently, I worked on a project called "Fairy Tailor" for the Chas
          Challenge, where our team of frontend developers built a full-stack
          application using OpenAI to generate stories. This experience allowed
          me to deepen my understanding of both frontend and backend
          technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy health and fitness, cooking, and learning
          new languages. I'm drawn to the challenge of exploring new languages
          and aspire to be a polyglot someday.
